# Procyon - A minimal Cosmos SDK chain

Procyon is the name of the star that represents maera (the hound) in the Virgo cluster. It is a copy of cosmos sdk `chain-minimal`, and is being used for researching module development.

`procyon` uses the **latest** version of the [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

### Installation

Install and run `procyon`:

```sh
make install # install the procyon binary
make init # initialize the chain
procyon start # start the chain
```

## Useful links

* [Cosmos-SDK Documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/)


## Used for cosmos module development

FIXME: Requires (for now) a local version of `envoy` module which this copy of chain-minimal is being used to develop

Parallel to this project, checkout the envoy module

```shell
git clone git@github.com:christophercampbell/envoy.git
```
